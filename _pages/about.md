<span class="tab">My name is **Ryan Walters** and this is my website. As the domain shows, my online handle is **Xevion**.</span>

As of <i>{{ page.last_modified_at | date: '%B %Y' }}</i>, I'm a Computer Science student studying at UTSA. Contact me if you're interested in working with me!

Software Engineering is one of my favorite things in the world; I adore projects relating to automation, pathfinding, group coordination and more...
I like working on big projects, APIs, competition/interview problems, and in general - learning how it all works!

Besides my interest in programming, I'm also pretty [big on photography](/photography/).

If you ever catch me playing a game, it's probably going to be *[Modded Minecraft][po2k]*, The Witcher 3, Factorio, or RimWorld.
