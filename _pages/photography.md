<br>
From a young age I accepted that I was a technically inclined person and art was not in my blood...
Pens, pencils and paints all failed to reflect my vision for art, and I became disinterested in dedicating myself further to it.

From then on art was a world I was not privy to - this all changed when I picked up <abbr title="a Nikon D3300, also my first camera">my sister's camera</abbr>.
I couldn't put it down, I couldn't stop messing with the settings, the angles, and trying new things. I was absolutely captured by photography that day.

Since then, I've slowly been dedicating myself more and more to photography as a way of artistic expression and out of technical curiosity.
I'm not the greatest, but it's a fun hobby, and I hope you like my work. The photos here are only a preview
and are not updated on any sort of frequency.
