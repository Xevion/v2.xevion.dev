My name is **Ryan Walters**. My online handle is **Xevion**, as the domain shows. I'm a Senior Highschooler currently
applying to colleges in order to major in Computer Science. While relatively inexperienced, I have a lot of drive to succeed
in Computer Science and put a great deal of my time and energy into it.

Outside of Computer Science, I really love photography. For me, it combines artistic release with the precision of digital work.
I also enjoy videogames like RimWorld, Factorio, Modded Minecraft and The Witcher 3. Automation, Base Building, Open
Worlds and Story really appeal to me.
